# Voice-based software companion for maintaining my Laptop charging using Python3

This software sends a voice message every time the charger is connected and reminds me to connect the charger if the battery percentage drops below 20%. If the charger is not connected, it sends a voice reminder every 30 seconds until it is connected. Similarly, it reminds me to disconnect the charger when the battery percentage reaches above 90% and sends a voice reminder every 30 seconds until the charger is disconnected.

Utilizing this system can enhance the longevity of your laptop's battery.
